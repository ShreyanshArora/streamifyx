# 📼 Streamifyx

**Streamifyx** is a scalable and modular backend platform designed for uploading and managing multimedia content. It focuses on secure file handling, metadata processing, and extensibility for future streaming or media-based features — all while maintaining clean and professional backend architecture.

> ⚠️ Work in Progress: Backend is partially implemented; no frontend yet.

- 📤 Video and media upload support (via Multer or Cloudinary)
- 🔐 Secure JWT-based Authentication (Access + Refresh Tokens)
- 📂 Organized media storage and retrieval system
- 📝 Metadata support: title, description, tags, categories
- 🧩 Modular backend structure for easy expansion (streaming, analytics, etc.)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js / Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB / PostgreSQL
- **Storage:** Multer or Cloudinary (configurable)
- **Authentication:** JWT
